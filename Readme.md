# SVM

Stack based virtual machine implemented in rust.\
It only supports integers as a data type and basic arithmetic, loops, conditionals and functions.\

## Examples

You can take a look for tests under `src/vm.rs` for examples.

## Roadmap

- Implement a simple grammer, lexer and paser so its easier to run it.

- More data types eg. floats, chars.
- Implement arrays.
- Exapand the instruction set.
- Implement sys calls.
- Build a webserver using this.
